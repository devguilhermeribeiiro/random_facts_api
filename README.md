<h1>Curious Facts</h1>

<p><strong>Curious Facts</strong> is a simple yet fun application that showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs. Each time you refresh the page, it connects to an external API to fetch 10 random facts and displays them on the screen. While it is a basic project, it demonstrates my skills in API integration, even though I am still in the learning phase.</p>
